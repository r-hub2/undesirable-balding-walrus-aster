  Data on life history traits for the partridge pea

\format{
  A data frame with records for 2235 plants.
  Data are already in \dQuote{long} format; no need to reshape.
   \describe{
    \item{resp}{Response vector.}
    \item{varb}{Categorical.  Gives node of graphical model corresponding
      to each component of \code{resp}.  See details below.}
    \item{root}{All ones.  Root variables for graphical model.}
    \item{id}{Categorical.  Indicates individual plants.}

\details{
The levels of \code{varb} indicate nodes of the graphical model to which
the corresponding elements of the response vector \code{resp} belong.
This is the typical \dQuote{long} format produced by the R \code{reshape}
function.  For each individual, there are several response variables.
All response variables are combined in one vector \code{resp}.
The variable \code{varb} indicates which \dQuote{original} variable
the number was for.  The variable \code{id} indicates which individual
the number was for.  The levels of \code{varb}, which are the names
of the \dQuote{original} variables are
\describe{
  \item{fecund}{Fecundity.  Bernoulli, One if any fruit, zero if no fruit.}
  \item{fruit}{Integer.  Number of fruits observed.  Greater than or equal
    3 if nonzero.}
  \item{seed}{Integer.  Number of seeds observed from a random sample of
    3 of the fruits for this individual.}
